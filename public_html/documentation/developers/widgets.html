<h2>Widgets</h2>

<p>
	Widgets are quite similar to <a href="developers/Widgets.html">Widgets</a>, in the way they are inserted into content, but they are
	a little more clever. They allow even your least experienced client or administrator to manage chunks of intelligent content on there 
	site without needing to learn loads of tags, HTML or call you in to help.
</p>

<p>
	Widget Areas can be defined (header, sidebar, news page footers, etc) then Widget Instances can be added in.
	Available Widgets currently include HTML blocks, Twitter Feeds, RSS Feeds, Google Maps and Social Bookmarks. More will be included over time,
	and you can make your own very easily.
</p>

<p>There places you can put your Widgets:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Standalone Widget <def>addons/widgets/<em>widgetname/widgetname</em>.php</def></li>
	<li>Modular Widget <def>addons/modules/<em>modulename</em>/widgets/<em>widgetname/widgetname</em>.php</def></li>
</ol>

<h3>Example usage</h3>

<p>All you need to do for this to work is open up a theme layout or page layout and enter:</p>

<pre><code class="html">{pyro:widgets:area slug="sidebar"}</code></pre>
