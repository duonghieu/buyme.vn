<h2>Pages Module</h2>


<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The Newsletter module is a quick way to create email "blasts" to send to your email newsletter subscribers.</p>

<h2>Subscribers</h2>

<p>To collect email addresses use the Newsletter Subscribe widget. Embed the widget anywhere on your site and
	let your visitors subscribe.</p>

<h2>Sending Newsletters</h2>

<p>Creating a newsletter is very similar to creating page content. Use the WYSIWYG editor to generate the html
	that will be used in the email. Keep in mind that any images that you place in the newsletter will be fetched
	from your server whenever the recipient reads the email. So don't delete the images from your server as soon as you send the blast.</p>
